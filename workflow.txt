///brief functional description

INPUTS: vehicle binary images, configuration workspace

Each iteration does the following:

1.  Reads image, scales to binary (if necessary) 
2.	Cuts image to vehicle dimensions and in half by height
3.  Filters out bottom vehicle contour
4.  Analyse contour (in learning phase outputs detected parameters in file)
5.  Performs detection algorithms
6.  Writes analysis results

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
 - Input Directory
 - Filter Type
 - Detection Params
 - Detection Algorithm
 - Output Configuration
